Artificial Intelligence &  Machine Learning: What's the difference7?
A Friendly Guide to Understanding AI Buzzwords


In our first article, we mentioned that there is a lot of buzz about artificial intelligence, big data, data science and machine learning. You may have also heard about deep learning, neural networks, or unsupervised learning. As we've found, it's sometimes hard to distinguish between all the different terms, so the purpose of this article is to bring clarity to the various concepts in artificial intelligence.

The Big Idea
As the diagram above shows, the two umbrella terms are artificial intelligence and big data. 

Artificial intelligence refers to software that solves tasks that people can do, from planning to recognizing objects and communicating.
- Alan Turing, German Enigma, Turing Test
- AI winters: the idea that AI can do everything followed by sharp disappointment and distrust


Big Data
- Large and large amounts of data
- Types of data: text, tabular, time series, pictures, audio/video
- <link> Big Data is not always useful!

Other terms
Data science is the application of AI principles on Big Data, which includes data collection, aggregation, processing, analysis and visualization. Machine learning is a subset of AI which uses learning algorithms to use training data to develop models and make predictions on actual data. Machine learning concepts fall into 3 categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. Supervised Learning refers to algorthms that use training data to build relationships between inputs and outputs, and includes concepts like regression, bayesian learning and deep learning (or neural networks, which refer to the same thing). Unsupervised Learning doesn't account for inputs and outputs, and aims at identifying trends, patterns and structure in data without prior knowledge to build the model.  Reinforcement Learning is an algorithm that approaches problems with a series of possible actions, decides on an action based on expected reward, and uses feedback to update the model to maximize its reward. As AI research continues to develop, the lines between the three subsets becomes less clear with semi-supervised models and combinations of 

That's our quick overview of AI terminology, so next time you'll be able to carry a conversation about AI.
